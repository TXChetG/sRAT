# sRAT

Squad Readiness Assessment Test (sRAT), is a SAAS developed to meet the needs of a flipped classroom environment utilizing a team-based learning approach. sRAT is a work in progress with continuous improvements occurring as scheduling allows.

## Goal

sRAT's primary goal is to be a simple tool for professors to bring into their classrooms where teams of students are collectively responding to quizzes. Traditional TRAT style quizzes have been delivered to students using series of premarked scratch-off cards. sRAT allows for professors to build their quiz questions and answers in whatever order desired, eliminating any risk of students figuring out a pattern.
